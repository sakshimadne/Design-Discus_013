          <h2>Google in the 1990s</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Overview:</strong> The 1990s marked the birth of Google as a
            search engine. Founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998, Google
            began as a research project at Stanford University. The initial
            version of Google was a simple search page with minimal design and a
            focus on providing fast, relevant search results.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Developments:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1996: The Beginning of BackRub</strong><br />
              The project that eventually became Google started as "BackRub," a
              research initiative led by Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford
              University. The name "BackRub" was chosen because the search
              engine analyzed backlinks to understand the importance of web
              pages. The focus of BackRub was to create a better search engine
              by leveraging a new technology called PageRank, which ranked web
              pages based on their link structure rather than just keyword
              matching.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1997: The Birth of the Google Name</strong>
              The domain name "google.com" was registered on September 15, 1997.
              The name "Google" is a play on the word "googol," which is a
              mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. This
              name reflects Larry and Sergey's mission to organize a seemingly
              infinite amount of information on the web. The project
              transitioned from BackRub to Google, and it began to gain traction
              as the search engine of choice among academics and researchers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1998: Incorporation and the First Funding</strong>

              Google was officially incorporated as a company on September 4,
              1998. The incorporation took place in the garage of Susan Wojcicki
              (now the CEO of YouTube), where Larry and Sergey had set up their
              office. Google received its first significant funding of $100,000
              from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This
              investment was critical in helping Google move out of the garage
              and into its first office in Menlo Park, California. In the same
              year, Google launched its first Doodle on its homepage,
              celebrating the Burning Man Festival. This marked the beginning of
              Google's tradition of using Doodles to commemorate special events.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1999: Rapid Growth and Moving to Mountain View</strong>
              Google moved to its current headquarters in Mountain View,
              California, famously known as the "Googleplex." The company also
              secured additional funding of $25 million from venture capital
              firms, including Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins. This funding
              fueled Google's rapid growth. Google introduced AdWords in 1999, a
              self-service program that allows businesses to run ads on Google.
              This was the beginning of Google's advertising empire.

                >2000: International Expansion and Language Support</strong
              >
              Google began its international expansion by launching Google in
              multiple languages, including French, German, Italian, Swedish,
              Finnish, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Chinese,
              Japanese, and Korean. Google also launched its image search
              feature in 2000, allowing users to search for images on the web,
              which became a hugely popular feature. The Google Toolbar was
              introduced, allowing users to search Google directly from their
              web browsers without going to the Google homepage.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Design:</strong> The early Google homepage was barebones,
            featuring just a search box and two buttons: "Google Search" and
            "I'm Feeling Lucky."

            far beyond search. The company introduced numerous products like
